# De-noising-the-audio-signal-Kaiser-window-method

In order to design a fir filter to achieve the de-noising of the speech signal processing, following steps must be carried out:
  
        • Collecting and sampling the speech signal
 
        • Adding random noise to the speech signal
 
        • Designing the parameters of fir filter
 
        • Completing the design and simulation via matlab
 
        • Verifying whether the simulation results meet the requirements.
